## 🛡 What is this?

**Web Application Attack Surface Analyzer & Exploit Engine** is a **full-stack automated penetration-testing framework** designed to behave like a real **red-team operator**.

It doesn’t just crawl websites — it **thinks like an attacker**.

It automatically:
- Maps everything an attacker can reach  
- Discovers user-controlled inputs  
- Actively exploits vulnerabilities  
- Scores risk based on impact  
- Generates professional security reports  

This is the same workflow used by **pentesters, red-teams, and bug bounty hunters**.

## 💣 What this tool actually does

| Capability | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Endpoint discovery | ✅ |
| JavaScript API mining | ✅ |
| Parameter fuzzing | ✅ |
| SQL Injection | ✅ |
| Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) | ✅ |
| Broken Access Control (IDOR) | ✅ |
| Exploit proof | ✅ |
| Risk scoring | ✅ |
| HTML & PDF pentest reports | ✅ |
| Multithreaded scanning | ✅ |

This is not a crawler.  
This is a **vulnerability exploitation engine**.

Every vulnerability is backed by **real payloads and server responses**, not guesses.

## 🧠 How it works

The engine runs in multiple automated phases:

1. **Endpoint Crawler**  
   Crawls internal pages and builds a list of reachable endpoints.

2. **JavaScript Miner**  
   Extracts hidden API routes and endpoints from JS files.

3. **Attack Surface Mapper**  
   Tags endpoints as HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW risk.

4. **Parameter Fuzzer**  
   Injects common parameter names (`id`, `user`, `q`, etc.) into endpoints.

5. **Parameter Discovery**  
   Detects which parameters are actually accepted by the backend.

6. **Exploit Engine**  
   Actively tests:
   - SQL Injection  
   - XSS  
   - IDOR (Broken Access Control)

7. **Risk Engine**  
   Scores vulnerabilities based on:
   - Endpoint sensitivity  
   - Exploit type  

8. **Pentest Report Generator**  
   Creates:
   - `report.html`
   - `pentest_report.pdf`  
   containing vulnerabilities, payloads, evidence, and severity.

## 📸 Sample Assessments (DVWA & Test Targets)

**DVWA Target Environment**  
This intentionally vulnerable web application (Damn Vulnerable Web App) was used to validate the scanner in a controlled and legal security-testing environment. It simulates real-world web application flaws for training and research.

</div><br><br>

**Automated Vulnerability Discovery & Risk Scoring**  
The engine identified multiple SQL Injection, XSS, and IDOR vulnerabilities and automatically classified them into CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, and LOW risk categories based on exploitability and impact.

</div><br><br>

**Exploit Proof with Payloads & Server Evidence**  
Every finding is backed by the exact payload used and the server response confirming the vulnerability, eliminating false positives and providing reproducible proof of exploitation.

**Live Exploit Engine in Action**  
The scanner actively fuzzes parameters, injects payloads, detects vulnerabilities, and validates access-control flaws in real time using a multithreaded attack pipeline.
